# F2Fusion
Pytorch implementation for "F2Fusion: Frequency Feature Fusion Network for Infrared and Visible Image based on Contourlet Transform and Mamba-UNet"

The source infrared and visible image pairs from M3FD and their fusion results are in .\M3FD and .\fusion_results, respectively.

We provide pre-trained model in the .\checkpoint file. Researchers can test fusion performance by running:

python test_fusion.py

More experimental details and codes will be released soon......
